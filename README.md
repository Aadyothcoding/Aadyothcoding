Hi there, I'm Aadyoth Sreeram üëã‚ú®

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I am currently pursuing a B.Tech in Electronics and Communication Engineering (ECE) with a specialization in Data Science at SRM Institute of Science and Technology. My interests span embedded systems, machine learning, and deep learning, with a particular focus on applications in healthcare systems and finance. I'm also exploring the fascinating domains of image processing and natural language processing (NLP), and I'm excited to delve deeper into these fields!

Beyond this, I'm an aspiring MERN stack and Django web developer with expertise in creating interactive and responsive web applications using HTML, CSS, and React. I thrive on opportunities to work on real-time projects and collaborate on innovative solutions, aiming to contribute to meaningful advancements in technology. üöÄ
